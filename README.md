# Twitter-Like 🐦
A small project to test my knowledge with Python and the Django FrameWork.

Might become a Frankenstein after a while, but hopefully it won't. 🤔

# Implementation 🤓💻
So... I'm basically just applying some concepts gradually inside the project and the idea is to deploy at some point to show how I can manage every aspect of a Web application on my own.

It might take a while, but surely will happen 😌

PS: I'm going to switch to class-based views at some point, but for now I'm sticking with function-based views just for the simplicity.
